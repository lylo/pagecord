<p>Hi there ( * ^ *) ノシ</p>

<p>Your 14-day free trial of Pagecord Premium has ended. Your blog at <a href="<%= blog_home_url(@blog) %>"><%= blog_home_url(@blog) %></a> is still live, but you no longer have access to premium features like custom domains, analytics, image uploads, custom CSS, or email subscriptions.</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Upgrade for only $<%= @price %>/year or $<%= @monthly_price %>/month</strong> to keep all the premium features. I think it's the best deal out there and it helps keep Pagecord running!
</div>

<p>Of course, you're welcome to continue using Pagecord for free. I hope you've enjoyed using it so far!</p>

<p>If you have any questions or feedback, just reply to this email. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
