Hi there

You signed up for Pagecord in <%= @blog.created_at.strftime("%B") %> but I noticed you haven't published any posts to your blog yet. I thought I'd check in personally to see if there's anything you need to get started?

Creating a post in Pagecord is as easy as sending an email from <%= @user.email %> to <%= @blog.delivery_email %>. If you prefer, you can log in and use the excellent rich text editor.

People sometimes struggle with what to write about (me too!), but try not to overthink it. Pagecord is really flexible — as well as long-form posts, you can post short updates like a photo from a recent trip, a link to an album you've discovered (Spotify, Apple Music and Bandcamp links are automatically embedded), or an interesting article you recently read. Kind of like you would with social media, but without the distraction!

You can now create a custom home page, as well pages like "About" or "Now" to customise your website. You can also add social links which appear as icons at the top of your blog.

New features are being added to Pagecord all the time. Stay tuned to the official blog at https://blog.pagecord.com for the latest updates.

Don't hestitate to get in touch if you have any feedback or questions. Until then, happy blogging!


Olly – creator of Pagecord
