<p>Hi there ( * ^ *) ノシ</p>

<p>Thanks so much for signing up to Pagecord!</p>

<p>Your blog is now live at <a href="<%= blog_home_url(@blog) %>"><%= blog_home_url(@blog) %></a>. Log in to create your first post, or try creating one by sending an email from <strong><%= @user.email %></strong> to <strong><%= @blog.delivery_email %></strong>.</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>You have 14 days of free access to all Premium features!</strong> This includes custom domains, blog analytics, image uploads and custom CSS. Give them a try!
</div>

<p>You can customise the look and feel of your blog in the <strong>Settings > Appearance</strong> area. You can also create a custom home page and even embed your latest posts and tags in it. See the <a href="https://help.pagecord.com">Pagecord Help Guide</a> to read about all the features!</p>

<p>After your trial you can continue using Pagecord for free, or you can upgrade for only $<%= @price %>/year or $<%= @monthly_price %>/month to keep all the premium features. I think it's the best deal out there and it helps keep Pagecord running!!</p>
