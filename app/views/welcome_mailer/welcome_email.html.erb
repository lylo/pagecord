<p>Hi there ( * ^ *) ノシ</p>

<p>Thanks so much for signing up to Pagecord!</p>

<p>Your blog is now live at <a href="<%= blog_home_url(@blog) %>"><%= blog_home_url(@blog) %></a>. To create a post, send an email from <strong><%= @user.email %></strong> to <strong><%= @blog.delivery_email %></strong> and Pagecord will do the rest. If you prefer, you can log in and create a post using the in-app editor.</p>

<p>You can customise the look and feel of your blog in the settings area. You can also create a custom home page and even embed your latest posts and tags in the page. See <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/create-a-custom-home-page-for-your-pagecord-blog">this blog post</a> for more details.</p>

<p>For only $<%= @price %>/year you can unlock Pagecord's premium features such as custom domain, blog analytics, image uploads, email subscriptions and reply by email. I think it's the best deal out there and it helps keep Pagecord running!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feedback or ideas, please drop me an email at <a href="mailto:hello@pagecord.com">hello@pagecord.com</a>. I'd love to know what you think of Pagecord, and I'm always happy to help!</p>
