Hi there ( * ^ *) ノシ

Thanks so much for signing up to Pagecord!

Your blog is now live at <%= blog_home_url(@blog) %>. Log in to create your first post, or creating it by sending an email from <%= @user.email %> to <%= @blog.delivery_email %>.

You can customise the look and feel of your blog in the settings area. You can also create a custom home page and even embed your latest posts and tags in the page. See the Pagecord Help Guide for all the details! -> https://help.pagecord.com.

You have 14 days of free access to all Premium features! This includes custom domains, blog analytics, image uploads, custom CSS, email subscriptions and reply by email. Give them a try!

After your trial, you can continue using Pagecord for free, or upgrade for only $<%= @price %>/year or $<%= @monthly_price %>/month to keep all the premium features. I think it's the best deal out there and it helps keep Pagecord running!

If you have any questions, feedback or ideas, please drop me an email at hello@pagecord.com. I'd love to know what you think of Pagecord, and I'm always happy to help!

Olly
