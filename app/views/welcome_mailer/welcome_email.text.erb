Hi there ( * ^ *) ノシ

Thanks so much for signing up to Pagecord!

Your blog is now live at <%= blog_home_url(@blog) %>. Log in to create your first post, or try creating one by sending an email from <%= @user.email %> to <%= @blog.delivery_email %>.

You have 14 days of free access to all Premium features! This includes custom domains, blog analytics, image uploads and custom CSS. Give them a try!

You can customise the look and feel of your blog in the Settings > Appearance area. You can create a custom home page and even embed your latest posts and tags in it. See the Pagecord Help Guide to read about all the features! -> https://help.pagecord.com.

After your trial you can continue using Pagecord for free, or you can upgrade for only $<%= @price %>/year or $<%= @monthly_price %>/month to keep all the premium features. I think it's the best deal out there and it helps keep Pagecord running!
