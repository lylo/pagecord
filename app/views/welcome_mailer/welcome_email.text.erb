Hi there ( * ^ *) ノシ

Thanks so much for signing up to Pagecord!

Your blog is now live at <%= blog_home_url(@blog) %>. To create a post, send an email from <%= @user.email %> to <%= @blog.delivery_email %> and Pagecord will do the rest. If you prefer, you can log in and create a post using the in-app editor.

You can customise the look and feel of your blog in the settings area. You can also create a custom home page and even embed your latest posts and tags in the page. See this blog post for more details -> https://blog.pagecord.com/create-a-custom-home-page-for-your-pagecord-blog.

For only $<%= @price %>/year you can unlock Pagecord's premium features such as custom domain, blog analytics, image uploads, email subscriptions and reply by email. I think it's the best deal out there and it helps keep Pagecord running!

If you have any questions, feedback or ideas, please drop me an email at hello@pagecord.com. I'd love to know what you think of Pagecord, and I'm always happy to help!

Olly
