Hi there 👋

I noticed you cancelled your Pagecord subscription. Sorry to see you go! I wondered if you had any feedback about the product and why it wasn't for you? This sort of feedback is really valuable, so I'd appreciate anything you can add.

Anything I can do to convince you to stick around?

Thanks so much,
Olly
