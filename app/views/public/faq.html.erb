  <h1 class="text-center">Frequently asked questions</h1>

  <h3>How does Pagecord work?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Create an account", new_signup_path %> by choosing a username and supplying your email address. Once you verify
    your email, you'll receive a secret email address. Emails sent to this secret address from the email address you give us will
    appear as posts on your Pagecord page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your Pagecord page is a public profile that anyone can view. It looks like <a href="https://pagecord.com/pagecord">https://pagecord.com/pagecord</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Do I own the content that I post?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. As long as what you post is your own work, you own it (posting copyrighted material that you don't own <a href="https://pagecord.com/terms">is a no-no</a>). Pagecord does not claim ownership of any content you post.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I add a bio to my page?</h3>
  <p>
    Yep! <%= link_to "Log in", login_path %> and in the <strong>Account</strong> section you'll see a field to add a bio to your profile.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I include images in my posts?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! You can attach images to your emails which Pagecord processes and hosts for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also include a URL to an existing image (e.g. https://example.com/image.gif)
    in the body of your email and Pagecord will render the image in the post. There are plenty of
    free image hosting sites out there such as <a href="https://postimages.org/">PostImage</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I embed media?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! If you include a link to a YouTube video, a Spotify album/playlist/track, or a Bandcamp album/track in your email, Pagecord will
    embed the media in the post.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I delete a post?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Log in", login_path  %> to your account and you'll see a list of posts. Click the trash icon next
    to a post to delete it.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I edit a post?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Log in", login_path  %> to your account and you'll see a list of posts. Click the edit icon next
    to a post to edit it.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I make a post without a title?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, just send an email with the post content in either the email subject or the body.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I export my posts</h3>
  <p>
    Not at the moment. They will all be in the Sent Items folder of your email account though 👌
  </p>


  <h3>Does Pagecord support RSS?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Just append <span class="font-mono">.rss</span> to the end of a profile page, e.g. <a href="https://pagecord.com/pagecord.rss">https://pagecord.com/pagecord.rss</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Can I follow other accounts?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! If you're logged into your Pagecord account, you will see a "Follow" button when you view another
    Pagecord. You can view all the posts of the accounts you follow in the Feed section of your
    account.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also subscribe to someone's Pagecord by RSS (as well as your private feed). RSS is awesome, you should check out
    <a href="https://feedgrab.net">Feedgrab</a> - a beautifully simple all-in-one reader I built! 🤙

  <h3 id="dns">How do I set up DNS for a custom domain?</h3>
  <p>
    If you're a paying customer, you can use your own domain name for your Pagecord. To host your Pagecord on a root domain
    (e.g. mydomain.com) you'll need to create the following DNS records:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Record Type</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>TTL</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>@</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>www</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    If you want your Pagecord on subdomain (eg: https://blog.mydomain.com), you'll need to create the following DNS records instead:
  </p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Record Type</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>TTL</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CNAME</td>
        <td><strong>blog</strong></td>
        <td>proxy.pagecord.com</td>
        <td>3600</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    <em>Note: If you're using Cloudflare to manage DNS, you need to set SSL/TLS mode to <strong>Full (Strict)</strong> or disable the proxy (the orange cloud).</em>
  </p>

  <h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>
  <p>
    If you've paid for an account and you decide you're unhappy with it, we'll refund your money if you've
    been a subscriber for less than a month. No questions asked (although we'd love to know why you didn't like it).
  </p>

  <h3>Can I downgrade my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Nope, there is no free account. We're considering allowing sites to go into read-only mode if paying customers cancel,
    but as of today if you stop paying the annual fee, your account will be deleted.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Log in, click the "Delete account" button at the bottom of the screen. This will
    display a confirmation, but once you confirm your account will be deleted immediatey.
  </p>
