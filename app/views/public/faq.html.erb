  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>How does Pagecord work?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Create an account", new_signup_path %> by choosing a username and supplying your email address. Once you verify
    your email, you'll receive a secret email address. Emails sent to this secret address from the email address you give us will
    appear as posts on your Pagecord page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your Pagecord page is a public profile that anyone can view. It looks like <a href="https://pagecord.com/pagecord">https://pagecord.com/pagecord</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I add a bio to my page?</h3>
  <p>
    Yep! <%= link_to "Log in", login_path %> and you'll see a field to add a bio to your profile.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I include images in my posts?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! Paying customers (only $<%= Subscription.price %>/year!) can attach images to their emails which
    Pagecord will process and host for you. We don't allow image uploads for free trials.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively you can include a URL to an existing image (e.g. https://example.com/image.gif)
    in the body of your email and Pagecord will display that image in the post. There are plenty of
    free image hosting sites out there such as <a href="https://postimages.org/">PostImage</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I delete a post?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Log in", login_path  %> to your account and you'll see a list of posts. Click the trash icon next
    to a post to delete it.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I edit a post?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= link_to "Log in", login_path  %> to your account and you'll see a list of posts. Click the edit icon next
    to a post to edit it.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I make a post without a title?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, just send an email with the post content in either the email subject or the body.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I export my posts</h3>
  <p>
    No, but they will all be in the Sent Items folder of your email account ðŸ‘Œ
  </p>

  <h3>Can I follow other accounts?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! If you're logged into your Pagecord account, you will see a "Follow" button when you view another
    Pagecord. You can view all the posts of the accounts you follow in the Feed section of your
    account.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also subscribe to someone's Pagecord by RSS (as well as your private feed). RSS is awesome, you should try it! ðŸ¤™
  </p>

  <h3>Does Pagecord support RSS?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Just append <span class="font-mono">.rss</span> to the end of a profile page, e.g. <a href="https://pagecord.com/pagecord.rss">https://pagecord.com/pagecord.rss</a>
  </p>

  <h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>
  <p>
    If you're a Pagecord Premium customer and you decide you're unhappy with it, we'll refund your money if you've
    been a subscriber for less than a month. No questions asked (although we'd love to know why you didn't like it).
  </p>

  <h3>Can I downgrade my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Nope, there is no free account. We're considering allowing sites to go into read-only mode if paying customers cancel,
    but as of today if you stop paying the annual fee, your account will be deleted.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
  <p>
    Log in, click the "Delete account" button at the bottom of the screen. This will
    display a confirmation, but once you confirm your account will be deleted immediatey.
