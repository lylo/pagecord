      Most blogging platforms are bloated with features you'll never use. Complex dashboards. Endless plugins. Theme customization rabbit holes. Before you know it, you've spent hours tweaking your blog instead of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pagecord is different. It's a minimalist blogging platform designed for one thing: getting your words out into the world. No clutter. No distractions. Just you and your writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write in a clean editor, or skip the editor entirely and blog by email. Hit send, and you're published. That's it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open source. Classic plan is free forever. Premium is $<%= localised_price %>/year.

    <p>
      What it does have: the most effortless way to write and share your thoughts with the world. Nothing more, nothing less.
