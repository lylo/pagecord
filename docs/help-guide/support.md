If you need some specific help with Pagecord that you can't find in the [Help Guide](/), these are the best ways to get in touch.

## GitHub Issues (Recommended)

GitHub is the best place to report bugs, request features, or raise general issues:

[https://github.com/lylo/pagecord/issues](https://github.com/lylo/pagecord/issues)

This keeps everything visible and trackable, and means other users can benefit from the discussion too.

## Email Support

You can email [hello@pagecord.com](mailto:hello@pagecord.com). I try my best to be proactive, and you'll definitely get a reply, but it's on a best-effort basis.

## Social Media

Pagecord has accounts on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pagecord.com) and [X](https://x.com/pagecord_) but these are only checked periodically – they're not really for support. If you definitely want a response, please use GitHub Issues or email instead.
