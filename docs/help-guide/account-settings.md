Manage your Pagecord account. Go to **Settings** → **My Account**.

## Changing your email address

1. Enter your new email address
2. Click **Change Email**
3. Check your new email for a verification link
4. Click the link to confirm the change

Your old email continues to work until you verify the new one.

## Time zone

Set your time zone to display dates and times in your local time. This affects how scheduled posts and analytics are shown.

## Password

Pagecord uses magic link emails by default — no password needed. If you prefer a password, click the link to set one via the forgot password flow.

## Sender email addresses

By default, you can only post by email from the address you signed up with. You can add up to 3 additional sender addresses:

1. Enter the email address
2. Click **Add Sender Email**
3. Check that email for a verification link
4. Click the link to confirm

Once verified, you can post to your blog from that address too.

## Deleting your account

To permanently delete your account:

1. Go to **Settings** → **My Account**
2. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
3. Click **Delete account**
4. Confirm when prompted

This cannot be undone. All your posts, pages, and data will be permanently deleted.
