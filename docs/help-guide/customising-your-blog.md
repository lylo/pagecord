Make your blog your own. All appearance settings are in **Settings** → **Appearance**.

## Bio

Add a short bio that appears on your blog's home page. This is a great place to introduce yourself to readers.

## Title

By default, your blog title is your username (e.g. @joel). You can change it to anything you like.

## Colour scheme

Choose from several pre-made themes:

- **Monochrome** — Clean black and white
- **Mint** — Soft green tones
- **Lavender** — Purple-tinted
- **Coral** — Warm peachy tones
- **Sand** — Earthy beige
- **Sky** — Light blue accents
- **Berry** — Pink and magenta

Or choose **Custom** to pick your own colours for background, text, and accent — for both light and dark mode.

All themes automatically support dark mode based on your reader's system preference.

## Font

Choose between three font styles:

- **Sans** — Clean, modern sans-serif
- **Serif** — Classic, traditional serif
- **Mono** — Monospaced, typewriter-style

## Content width

Control how wide your content appears:

- **Narrow** — Tighter column, great for reading
- **Standard** — Balanced width
- **Wide** — More room for images and content

## Layout

Choose how posts appear on your home page:

- **Stream** — Full post content in a vertical feed
- **List of Titles** — Compact list with dates and titles
- **Cards** — Grid of cards with excerpts

## Avatar

Premium feature. Upload an image that appears next to your blog title.

## Branding

Premium feature. Choose whether to hide the Pagecord logo at the bottom of your blog (please consider keeping it to spread the good word about Pagecord!)
