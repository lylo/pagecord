It is possible to import existing blog content from other platforms into Pagecord, but this is not self-serve. Please contact support so we can take a look and handle it for you. If the import is possible a Premium subscription is required to proceed after you've verified it.

## What we can import

Imports are possible from:

- WordPress
- Ghost
- Pika
- Bear
- Jekyll / Static site

As long as there's a decent export from your system, we can probably import it.

## Recommendations

- **Keep your old blog live** until the import is complete (we typically need to grab images from it)
- **Let us know** if you have any posts you don't want imported

## Ready to switch?

Email [hello@pagecord.com](mailto:hello@pagecord.com?subject=Blog%20Import%20Request) with:

1. Your Pagecord domain
2. The platform you're importing from
3. Your export file (or a link to your existing blog if you need help exporting)

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether we can import from your platform, just ask. We're happy to help figure it out.
