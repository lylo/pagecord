Premium feature. Let readers subscribe to your blog and receive your posts by email.

## Enabling email subscriptions

1. Go to **Settings** → **Audience**
2. Check **Email subscriptions enabled**
3. Click **Update**

When enabled, subscribers receive an email digest of your latest posts every Tuesday morning (in your blog's configured time zone).

## Displaying the subscription form

You can show the subscription form in two places:

- **Blog header** — Appears at the top of your home page
- **Post footer** — Appears at the bottom of individual posts

Enable either or both options in the Audience settings.

You can also embed the form on any page using the `{{ email_subscription }}` [dynamic variable](https://help.pagecord.com/dynamic-variables-for-pages).

## Viewing your subscribers

Go to **Settings** → **Audience** to see how many confirmed subscribers you have. For privacy reasons there's no option to view or download your list of subscribers. If you want to migrate elsewhere, submit a support ticket for an export.

## Subscriber limits

The current limits are:

- Premium accounts include 100 email subscribers
- Pro accounts ($99/year) include 2,000 subscribers
