Pagecord was built around email. You can publish posts directly from your inbox – it's an effortless way to blog!

## Your unique delivery email address

Every Pagecord account gets a unique delivery email address. You'll find it in **Settings**. It looks something like `myblog_abc123@post.pagecord.com`.

Keep this address private, although emails still need to come from the address you signed up with (or an additional sender address that you can add).

## How it works

Send an email to your posting address:

- **Subject line** becomes the post title (leave it blank for a title-free post)
- **Email body** becomes the post content
- **Inline Attachments** are included as images directly in the post. Standard attachments are added as images at the end of a post. Note: only paying customers get attachment support!

Your post is published immediately.

## Formatting

The email body is converted to rich text. You can use basic HTML formatting if your email client supports it (most do).

Every email client does this differently but Pagecord tries its best to figure out the correct formatting. Handy tips:

- Write in your email client as you normally would
- Bold and italic formatting is preserved
- Line breaks and paragraphs are preserved
- Links are automatically detected
- Images are included (premium customers only)

## Adding images

Paying customers can attach images to an email and these appear in the post.

## Adding tags

Include hashtags **on a separate line** and **at the end of your post** for them to be extracted as tags on the post, e.g.

```javascript
Just visited Tokyo for the first time!

#travel #japan
```

The hashtags are extracted and converted to tags called **travel** and **japan**. The hashtags won't appear in the post content.

## Tips

- Save your posting address as a contact in your email client for easy access
- Use your phone's share menu to email photos directly to your blog

## Troubleshooting

If your post doesn't appear:

- Check the email was sent from the right email address. This must be the email address you signed up with! This is the most common issue people face. You can add up to three additional sender email addresses in the settings so you can publish from different addresses.Look in your spam folder for any bounce messages

Posts from email are published immediately — there's no draft state. If you need to edit, you can do so in the app after it's published.
