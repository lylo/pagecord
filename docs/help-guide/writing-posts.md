Everything you need to know about creating and formatting posts in Pagecord.

## The editor

Pagecord uses a rich text editor with Markdown support. You can use the toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, or type Markdown directly.

### **Keyboard shortcuts**

```javascript
Bold Cmd/Ctrl + B
Italic Cmd/Ctrl + I
Link Cmd/Ctrl + K
```

### **Markdown shortcuts**

The editor recognises Markdown as you type:

```javascript
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__

## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

- Bullet list
- Another item

1. Numbered list
2. Another item

> Blockquote

`inline code`
```

For code blocks, use triple backticks. You can specify a language for syntax highlighting:

```ruby
```ruby
def hello
puts "Hello, world!"
end
``
```

### Adding images

Drag and drop images directly into the editor, or click the picture button in the toolbar.

## Post Titles

Titles are optional on posts, but required on pages (except the home page, which is a special case). Leave the title field blank if you want a title-free post.

Title-free posts work well for:

- Quick thoughts or observations
- Photos
- Quotes
- Short updates

## Tags

Add tags to organise your posts by topic. Readers can click a tag to see all posts with that tag.

To add tags, select the **Add Tags** option from the drop-down menu above the editor.

Tags appear at the bottom of your post and in your blog's tag list.

## Scheduling posts

Want to publish later? Click **Change Publication Time** from the drop-down menu and pick a future date. The post will go live at that time.

## Drafts

Posts are saved as drafts automatically in your browser as you write, but you should click **Save Draft** to return to it later. Draft posts appear at the top of your post list.

## Changing the post slug

A slug is the end part of the URL that looks like `/my-first-post`. This is set automatically when you create a post, but you can change it by selecting **Change Slug** from the drop-down menu when editing (or creating) a post.

## Hidden posts

You can hide a post from your blog feed while keeping it accessible via its direct link. This is useful for posts you want to share privately or keep as a reference without showing them on your blog.

To hide a post, select **Post Visibility** from the drop-down menu and check "Hide this post on my blog".

## Canonical URLs

If you're cross-posting content from another site, you can set a canonical URL to tell search engines where the original version lives. This helps avoid duplicate content issues.

To set a canonical URL, select **Canonical URL** from the drop-down menu when editing a post.

## Deleting posts

To delete a post, select **Delete Post** from the drop-down menu. Deleted posts are moved to the trash and kept for 30 days, so you can restore them if you change your mind.
