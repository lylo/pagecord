## Your blog URL

Initially your blog lives on a subdomain at `yourusername.pagecord.com`. You can share this link right away — no setup required.

If you have a premium subscription, you can connect your own domain name later.

## Publishing your first post

There are two ways to publish on Pagecord.

### Option 1: Use the in-app editor

1. Log in to your [dashboard](https://pagecord.com/app)
2. Click **New Post**
3. Write your content
4. Click **Publish**

That's it. Your post is now live :)

### Option 2: Post by email

Every Pagecord account has a unique email address for sending posts to. You'll find it in your [Settings](https://pagecord.com/app/settings).

Send an email to your secret delivery email:

- **Subject line** becomes the post title (optional — leave it blank for a title-free post)
- **Email body** becomes the post content
- **Attachments** are automatically included as images

This is perfect for posting from your phone or when inspiration strikes away from your desk.

## Adding a title (optional)

Pagecord doesn't require titles. Some posts are better without them — a quick thought, a photo, a quote.

If you do want a title, just add it in the title field when writing in the app, or use the subject line when posting by email.

## Changing the language

You can change the language of your blog's interface elements (like email subscription forms) in **Settings → Blog Settings**.
