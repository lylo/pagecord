Pagecord has a few settings to help search engines and social platforms understand your blog. You'll find these in **Settings → Blog Settings**.

## SEO Blog Title

By default, your blog name is used in the HTML title tag for search engines and social sharing. If you want something different to appear in search results — like "Ben's Blog - Thoughts on technology" — you can set that as an SEO title override.

## Google Site Verification

If you use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console), you can add your verification code here. Pagecord will add the appropriate `<meta>` tag to your blog's HTML.

Just paste the verification code (or the full meta tag — Pagecord will extract the code automatically).

## Fediverse Author Attribution

If you're on Mastodon or another Fediverse platform, you can enter your Fediverse username (e.g. `@you@mastodon.social`) so that your posts are attributed to you when shared on those platforms.

## Search Engine Indexing

Blogs on a custom domain can opt out of search engine indexing. When unchecked, Pagecord serves a `robots.txt` that discourages search engines from indexing your site.

All Pagecord blogs are automatically configured to discourage AI crawlers regardless of this setting.
