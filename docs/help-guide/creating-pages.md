Pages are for content that lives outside your blog feed. Use them for an About page, Archive, Contact, or a custom home page.

## Pages vs posts

- **Posts** appear in your blog feed and are sorted by date
- **Pages** are standalone and only accessible via direct links or navigation

## Creating a page

1. Go to **Pages** in your dashboard
2. Click **New Page**
3. Add a title (required for pages)
4. Write your content
5. Click **Publish**

## Setting a custom home page

By default, your blog's home page shows your posts. You can replace this with a custom page:

1. Create a new page (the title can be left blank for home pages)
2. Publish it
3. From the drop-down menu, select **Set as Home Page**

Your custom home page can include [dynamic variables](https://help.pagecord.com/dynamic-variables-for-pages) to display post lists, tags, and more.

## Adding pages to your navigation

Once you've created a page, you can add it to your blog's header navigation. See [Setting up navigation](https://help.pagecord.com/setting-up-navigation) for details.

## Example pages

Common pages people create:

- **About** — Tell readers who you are
- **Archive** — A full list of posts using `{{ posts_by_year }}`
- **Now** — What you're currently up to (a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about))
- **Uses** — Tools and software you use
- **Contact** — How to get in touch
