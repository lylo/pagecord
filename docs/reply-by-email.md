# Reply by email

Let readers reply to your posts via email. When someone clicks the reply link on a post, they get a form to fill in with their name and email, and a message for you. You will receive this message directly in your inbox. Your email address isn't revealed, unless you choose to reply to the email.

This is a premium feature.

## Enabling reply by email

1. Go to **Settings** → **Email**
2. Toggle on **Reply by email**

Once enabled, a reply link appears at the bottom of each post.

## Tips

- Replies go directly to the email address that you subscribed to Pagecord with
- You can reply back normally from your email client to continue the conversation
