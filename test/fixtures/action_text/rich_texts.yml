    Street photography is a fascinating genre that offers a raw, unscripted, and candid look into everyday life. It captures the beauty of ordinary moments, turning them into extraordinary images. It's about documenting society and people in their natural environment, without any pretense or setup.
    </p>
    <p>
    The beauty of street photography lies in its spontaneity. It's about capturing that fleeting moment that might never occur again. It could be a glance, a gesture, a play of light and shadow, or a unique juxtaposition. The streets are full of such moments, waiting to be captured.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the key aspects of street photography is the ability to anticipate moments. This requires a keen eye for details and a deep understanding of human behavior. It's about being in the right place at the right time, and more importantly, being ready to capture the moment when it happens.

    Street photography is also about telling stories. Each image is a snapshot of a larger narrative. It's about capturing the essence of life in a single frame. The viewer is left to fill in the details and complete the story in their mind.
    </p>
    <p>
    In conclusion, street photography is a challenging yet rewarding genre. It pushes you to step out of your comfort zone, to see the world from a different perspective, and to find beauty in the mundane. It's a genre that truly celebrates the art of observation and storytelling.

    <p>Landscape photography is a genre that captures <i>the beauty of nature in all its grandeur</i>. It's about capturing the essence of a place, the mood, the light, and the emotions it evokes.</p>

    <p>One of the key aspects of landscape photography is the use of natural light. The golden hours of sunrise and sunset offer the most dramatic light, casting long shadows and bathing the landscape in a warm, golden glow. But other times of day, like the blue hour or the harsh midday sun, can also offer interesting opportunities for creative photography.</p>

    <p>Composition is another crucial element in landscape photography. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>, leading lines, and the use of foreground elements are some of the techniques that can be used to create compelling compositions. But rules are meant to be broken, and sometimes the most stunning images come from thinking outside the box and experimenting with different perspectives.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, landscape photography is a genre that requires patience, planning, and a deep love for nature. It's about being in the right place at the right time, and more importantly, being able to see and capture the beauty that is often overlooked.</p>

      Yesterday I discovered an interesting bug in our deployment pipeline. The issue started when we upgraded
      our Docker images to use the latest Alpine Linux base, but somehow missed updating the Node.js version.&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div></div>
    <div>The error message was cryptic at first, but after digging into the logs I found this:</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <blockquote>Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs/promises' in '/app/src/utils'</blockquote>
    <div><br></div>
    <div>
      Turns out we were still running Node 12 in the container, but our code was using fs/promises which was
      only stabilized in Node 14. The fix was straightforward once we identified the root cause.
    </div>
    <div></div>
    <pre>
      // Updated package.json to specify engine requirements
      {
        "engines": {
          "node": ">=14.0.0",
          "npm": ">=6.0.0"
        }
      }
    </pre>
    <div></div>
    <div>
      This reminded me why it's important to keep our development and production environments in sync.
      We've now added automated checks to catch version mismatches before they make it to production.&nbsp;
