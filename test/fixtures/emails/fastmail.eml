*It's alive! *

Say hello to Pagecord ( * ^ *) =E3=83=8E=E3=82=B7**

It's a minimalist blogging / writing app driven entirely by email. To pu=
blish, simply send an email to your unique Pagecord email address and it=
 will appear on your blog. That's it!

Pagecord is minimal in how it looks, but also in what it does. You can u=
se basic markup like *bold*, *italic*, strikethough, links <https://www.=
youtube.com/watch?v=3DdQw4w9WgXcQ> and whatnot in your writing. And you =
can use emojis =F0=9F=A5=B3  But you can't add images. I'm considering a=
 premium tier <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5AOBhsW_geuGSN=
joQaN1luzISJRfaBxhW2tXP31qchPSdNQ/viewform> which would support this, bu=
t since it's free I want to keep everything simple and cheap to operate.

You can use Pagecord like a traditional blogging app, where the email su=
bject is the post title and the body is the content. You can also use it=
 like a micro-blog if you prefer, by sending emails with your thoughts i=
n title and leaving the body blank =E2=80=93 this way your page will be =
a super-minimal stream of consciousness.=20

It's just a bit a fun really. Give it a go and let me know what you thin=
k <mailto:hello@pagecord.com>!
